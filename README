This is a script that can download, process, and save the animal images
as a tensorflow dataset.

## WOW also train a model! ##

Usage:
	To run for the first time:
		python3 load-dataset.py
		python3 trainmodel.py
	
	To update the animal pictures from the ftp server:
		python3 load-dataset.py download
		python3 load-dataset.py -download
		python3 load-dataset.py --download
		python3 load-dataset.py d
		python3 load-dataset.py -d
		python3 load-dataset.py --d
	
When run for the first time, it places a hidden file named
".isnotfirstdownload" in the base directory so that it will skip the
download step.


TODO:
Add checkpoint folder to the directory maker.

Figure out what the predicted output means; if error.

Remove the manually made validation set. We only need to create the
training set and the test set. The validation set can be created
automatically by the .fit function.

Implement ROC curve to see if it is really a good fit. The test set has
more  interesting than not so it will only be statistically significant
if there are not many false positives / false negatives.

Clean up code. Make the loading and training steps independent. Right
now, the images are normalized in the loading step-- some models need
specific normalizations like [-1,1] or [0,1] etc.

Implement more models. Use more prebuild models as bases. Also change
the additional layers on the bottom.

More command line control of flags.

Make file stuff windows friendly by using os.path library
